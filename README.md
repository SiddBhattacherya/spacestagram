# SPACESTAGRAM

A web application for viewing and liking your favourite pictures from Nasa's Picture of the Day! Feel free to give it a try!

I have added a "press down" animation when the user clicks on a button, as well as an animation when users hover over the images. Finally, there is a loading spinner to wait while
the pictures load from the API call.
